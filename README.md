# **Pipelines for Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) Classification**
**⚠️ Note: This repository is currently under preparation. Some files, notebooks, or documentation may be incomplete or subject to change. Please check back later for the finalized version.**

This repository presents the two pipelines described in our paper **"Transfer Learning on Protein Language Models Improves
Antimicrobial Peptide Classification"** for performing Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) Classification:

1. **Embedding-Based Approach**:  
   A pipeline that uses pretrained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to extract embeddings from protein sequences, which are then utilized for AMP classification using shallow classifiers.

2. **LoRA Fine-Tuning Approach**:  
   A pipeline that applies Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune PLMs for AMP classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.
